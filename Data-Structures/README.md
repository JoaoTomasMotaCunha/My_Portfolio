# Phylogenetic Tree Construction of Pit Vipers

This project focuses on constructing phylogenetic trees for 40 DNA sequences of pit vipers using different algorithms and methods, including **UPGMA**, **Neighbor-Joining (NJ)**, and **Parsimony (Fitch/Sankoff)**. The sequences were obtained from NCBI's PopSet database.

## Project Overview
This project builds phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences of pit vipers. The workflow includes sequence alignment, distance matrix calculation, and tree construction using various methods such as UPGMA, NJ, and Parsimony. The resulting trees are visualized and compared to explore the evolutionary relationships among the species.

## Objectives
- Construct phylogenetic trees using UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, and Parsimony methods.
- Visualize the resulting trees to examine the evolutionary relationships between pit viper species.
- Compare the tree topologies generated by each method.

## Technologies and Tools
The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Biopython**: For handling sequence data, performing alignments, and constructing phylogenetic trees.
- **MUSCLE**: A tool for multiple sequence alignment.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing the phylogenetic trees.
  
## Dataset
The project uses DNA sequences of pit vipers from the NCBI PopSet database:
- [NCBI PopSet - Pit Vipers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset/1940952900)
- File: `PopSet_vipers.fasta`

The sequences are aligned using the **MUSCLE** algorithm and saved in ClustalW format (`PopSet_vipers_alig.clw`).

## Phylogenetic Methods

### UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)
- A distance-based hierarchical clustering method.
- Assumes a constant rate of evolution.

### Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
- A distance-based method that does not assume a constant rate of evolution.
- Constructs trees by minimizing the total branch length.

### Parsimony
- Uses the Fitch algorithm to minimize the number of evolutionary changes.
- The tree is optimized to reflect the simplest evolutionary path.

## Results
The project produces the following files:

### UPGMA Tree:
- **XML file**: `upgma_tree.xml`
- **Cladogram image**: `viper_cladogram1.png`

### NJ Tree:
- **XML file**: `nj_tree.xml`
- **Cladogram image**: `viper_cladogram2.png`

### Parsimony Tree:
- **XML file**: `fitch_tree.xml`
- **Cladogram image**: `viper_cladogram3.png`

Each tree provides a visual representation of the evolutionary relationships between the species in the dataset. The trees are rooted, and their topologies can be compared to assess the consistency of the evolutionary patterns across different algorithms.

## Future Work
- **Bootstrap Analysis**: Implement bootstrap resampling to assess the statistical confidence of the phylogenetic trees.
- **Maximum Likelihood**: Introduce Maximum Likelihood methods for more accurate tree building.
- **Evolutionary Models**: Explore different evolutionary models for the analysis of pit viper evolution.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Implement interactive tools for visualizing the trees and comparing the different methods.
