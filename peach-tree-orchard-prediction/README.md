# Peach Tree Orchard Health and Vigor Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting the health and vigor of peach trees using multispectral images and machine learning techniques. Although the programming code is not yet available, the core concept revolves around leveraging multispectral data captured via drones, applying image processing techniques, and using a Faster R-CNN model for canopy detection and vegetation index calculation.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using drone-captured multispectral images to assess the health and vigor of peach trees in an orchard. The data will be processed using machine learning models like Faster R-CNN for tree canopy detection. Vegetation indices such as NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE, and REGNDVI will be calculated from the multispectral images to evaluate the health of each tree.

## Objectives
- Detect and segment individual peach trees from multispectral images.
- Calculate relevant vegetation indices to assess the health and vigor of the trees.
- Develop a tool that allows users to analyze multispectral images for orchard health monitoring.

## Technologies and Tools
While the programming code is still in development, the following technologies and tools are planned to be used:
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For developing and training the Faster R-CNN model
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks
- **MicaSense RedEdge-MX Camera**: Used for capturing multispectral images
- **LabelImg**: Planned for annotating the training dataset

## Dataset
The project will utilize multispectral images of peach trees captured at Quinta Nova orchard in Tortosendo, Portugal. These images are captured using the MicaSense RedEdge-MX camera, which has five spectral bands: Blue, Green, Red, Red Edge, and Near-Infrared (NIR).

## Vegetation Indices
Several vegetation indices are planned to be used to measure tree health:
- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**: Measures "greenness" and overall plant health.
- **GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**: A variant of NDVI using the green band, suitable for chlorophyll estimation.
- **NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge Index)**: Helps in detecting chlorophyll content in leaves.
- **REGNDVI (Red Edge Green NDVI)**: A combination of the Red Edge and Green bands to enhance the detection of plant stress.

## Planned Features
- **Faster R-CNN for Tree Detection**: A deep learning model to detect and segment peach trees from the images.
- **Calculation of Vegetation Indices**: Automatically calculate NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE, and REGNDVI for each tree.
- **Health Analysis Reports**: Generate reports that include health metrics for individual trees.
- **Visualization**: Provide visual output for detected canopies and vegetation indices.

## Installation (Future)
Once the code is ready, installation instructions will be provided here.

## Usage (Future)
Steps for running the model and calculating vegetation indices will be added when the code is available.

## Future Work
- Finalize the development of the Faster R-CNN model for accurate tree detection.
- Automate the calculation of vegetation indices for multiple images.
- Explore adding more sophisticated health metrics and real-time monitoring capabilities.
